Exercise 2: Website Automation
In the class automation_test.js, we focused on automating a test case using Cypress to search for the term "automation" on Google, navigate to the relevant Wikipedia page, and capture a screenshot of a specific section. The test involves handling cross-origin navigation using the cy.origin() command.

How to Access the Screenshot
The captured screenshot, named Wikipedia_Page_Complete.png, can be found in the project's cypress/screenshots directory.

For more details on the test implementation, please refer to the source code and test scripts provided in this repository.
